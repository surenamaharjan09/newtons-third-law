        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>This website dives into Newton's Third Law, one of the foundational principles of physics discovered by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687. It explains how forces always come in pairs—action and reaction—that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.</p>
        <p>Explore the sections to learn facts, see experiments, view images, and enjoy stories that bring the law to life.</p>
